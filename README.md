Project Catherine Quinlan: Wind Turbine Energy project based on Wind speed to calculate power supplied November 2020


# MLSWindproject
Predictive wind turbine supplies of electricity based on wind speed  

### Requirements:
Prepare web site to supply predicted values of energy from wind turbine given random value for wind speed at m/s between 0 and 25m/s
Use diffrent forms of models to achieve the above
Supply the additional files to support the website

### My Approach:
Firstly given the data, I set about using the regression methods that we were looking at. Originally I was thinking it was possibly a cubic function, until sigmoid was used in our notes. I then tried to test and train the data seeking out similarities. I then felt that we really should be looking at both x and y being inputs and began to create a nueron but was unsure of how to approach the function, as I felt it would have 2 inputs, 2 weights etc
With regard, to the website I have created a basic website and it  needs more work to connect other files like linear to supply the result expected.
